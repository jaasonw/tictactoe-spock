#  tictactoe-spock

It's a multiplayer tictactoe game ported to the Spock (Svelte + Pocketbase) stack for no other reason than I saw a Fireship video on it. Much of the code and design was ported from my CPSC 349 - Web Frontend projects so credit where credit is due to those who also contributed to this project
